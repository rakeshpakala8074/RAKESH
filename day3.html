<h2>CARRER OBJECTS</H2>
<P>Know that recruiters have piles of applications flying in and they spare 2-3 minutes max on each application. So your task is to lock the recruiter's attention on your resume.
The first suggestion before every job application or HR interview question is to do your research and read the job description thoroughly.
Going through the job description allows you to gauge the skills to put on a resume by aligning them to the recruiterâ€™s requirements.
However, do make sure that you actually possess the skills or have plans to acquire knowledge on them. Lying on your resume will land you in trouble sooner or later.</P>
